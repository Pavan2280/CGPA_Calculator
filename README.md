# CGPA_Calculator with GUI (Tkinter)

This repository contains two Python code files for calculating Cumulative Grade Point Average (CGPA) using GUI.

+ 1) cgpa_cal.py: This Python script is designed for individual use. It allows a single user to input their marks, calculates their CGPA, and provides the result for that individual student.
+ 2) cgpa_cal_mutiple_student.py :This Python script is intended for use with a group of students, specifically up to five students. It likely allows multiple users to input their marks, calculates the CGPA for each student, and may even generate a bar graph to visually represent the CGPAs of these students for comparison.
+ Additionally, this project utilizes Tkinter, a Python library, for GUI development, creating interactive desktop applications.
